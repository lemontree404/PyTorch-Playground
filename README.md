# PyTorch Playground
PyTorch Playground is a web-based application for training neural network models using the PyTorch library. With this app, you can select from several problem statements and customize your neural network architecture using a simple web form. The application outputs a graph of the model's performance, allowing you to visualize its accuracy and adjust its parameters as needed.
